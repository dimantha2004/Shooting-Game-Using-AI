# AI‑Powered Shooting Game

## About
An interactive 2D shooting game where AI-controlled bots learn to aim and react using reinforcement learning techniques. The objective is to simulate realistic bot behavior that improves over time.

## Features
- 🎯 Dynamic bot aiming via Reinforcement Learning (QLearning/DQN)  
- 🕹️ Smooth gameplay with player vs. bot interaction  
- 📊 Training visualization: reward curves, agent improvement  
- 🧩 Modular architecture: swap AI algorithms easily

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pygame) or Unity (C#)  
- RL Framework: TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Data visualization: Matplotlib
